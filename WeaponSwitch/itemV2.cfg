description = "Fix for all the weapon switching foibles.

Some disclosure:
This does bring back the Bounty Hunter swap to melee abuse, but this is actually fixable by checking if a melee weapon dealt the killing blow, not the equipped weapon. It also introduces some animation cancelling for faster attacks, this could be fixed by allowing you to do q->q quicly, but introducing a cooldown q->q->cooldown->q. These are things you'd have to consciously abuse, so I'm not bothered about it on the mod realm.
But all this means the mod isn't getting sanctioned in its current state. I want to see how receptive Fatshark is to bugfix mods first before spending time making any of the changes above. And this really is something Fatshark should fix themselves, it's a pretty big deal gameplay-wise.

MAKE SURE THE MOD LOAD ORDER IS CORRECT: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you see on the right above this mod.";
