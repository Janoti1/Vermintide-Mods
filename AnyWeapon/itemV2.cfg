description = "Equip a handgun/hagbane combo on slayer and whatever else. Should use a separate matchmaking queue, so only people running the mod as well can join your game.

Note that trying to circumvent this can lead to those weapons crashing other people that are not running the mod as well!

Wizards staffs and drake-weapons will crash unless you switch to Sienna/Bardin and equip the weapon on them first before switching back, thereby letting the game load the stuff it needs.
Bots don't like using weird combos as well and crash the game.

MOD LOAD ORDER: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you can see on the right above this mod.";
