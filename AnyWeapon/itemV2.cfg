description = "Equip a handgun/hagbane combo on slayer and whatever else. Should use a separate matchmaking queue, so only people running the mod as well can join your game.

Wizards staffs will crash unless you switch to Sienna and equip the staff on her first before switching back, thereby letting the game load the stuff it needs.

Very untested. Might have to take down if buggy/abusive.

MOD LOAD ORDER: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you can see on the right above this mod.";
