The mod is completely automated and will always have all the stuff that is in the actual game. Nowadays FS is a lot more careful about including WIP or unreleased stuff.

Use the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1687843693]Save Weapon mod[/url] for the game to remember equipped items between sessions.

Use with AnyWeapon for cross-dressing hats.

MAKE SURE THE MOD LOAD ORDER IS CORRECT: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you see on the right above this mod.
