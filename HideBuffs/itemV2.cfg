description = "PROTIP: F4 is the shortcut to open the mod options. You'll need it.
Also to move to first spot inside mod options click the star left of the mod name, like in the screenshot.

Compatible with Numeric UI mod.
Adds a Priority Buff Bar that is positioned mid-screen for important timed buffs.
Options to reposition, scale, and change direction of UI elements.
Options to hide UI elements or make them less obtrusive.
Options to prevent passive and aura buffs from showing on the UI.

Preset uploading:
Added /ut_upload_settings for those of you who'd like to share your UI Tweaks settings with others. It uploads mod settings to my server, so I can add them them as a preset for other to use in the future.

What it sends: your UI Tweaks settings, screen_resolution, hud_scale value(0-100), is hud_scaling_enabled in options, is_hud_scaling_limited option.

To add a comment to your upload write:
/ut_upload_settings Author Prop Joe. This is my preset that mimics Total War UI.

You'll need to write your name in the comment, otherwise it'll be put up as an anonymous preset.

MAKE SURE THE MOD LOAD ORDER IS CORRECT: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you see on the right above this mod.
