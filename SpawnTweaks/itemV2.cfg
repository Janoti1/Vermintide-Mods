MAKE SURE THE MOD LOAD ORDER IS CORRECT: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you see on the right above this mod.

Added rudimentary support for saving SpawnTweaks mod settings into presets. To save your settings into a new true_solo preset:
/save_preset true_solo
/load_preset true_solo
To delete the preset /delete_preset true_solo

Changes since last version:
added way to disable specials by type, i.e. way to only spawn Assassins
