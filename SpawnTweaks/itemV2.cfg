title = "Spawn Tweaks";
description = "Adds a bevy of options to customize game difficulty.

MAKE SURE THE MOD LOAD ORDER IS CORRECT: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you see on the right above this mod.

Added rudimentary support for saving SpawnTweaks mod settings into presets. To save your settings into a new true_solo preset:
/st_save_preset true_solo
/st_load_preset true_solo
To delete the preset:
/st_delete_preset true_solo

Changes since last version:
- option for patrols to aggro on spawn
- enable all map boss triggers to be only patrols or only bosses or both
- hordes come from both directions(doesn't work with blob horde type, I suggest you use the option to disable blob hordes)
