title = "Spawn Tweaks - needs 2.0 testing";
description = "Adds a bevy of options to customize game difficulty and modify game logic.

Expanded the scope of the mod to include mutator options as a way to empower users to create their own mutators and game modes, as well as offering some built-in mutators.

MAKE SURE THE MOD LOAD ORDER IS CORRECT: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you see on the right above this mod.

Added rudimentary support for saving SpawnTweaks mod settings into presets. To save your settings into a new true_solo preset:
/st_save_preset true_solo
/st_load_preset true_solo
To delete the preset:
/st_delete_preset true_solo
