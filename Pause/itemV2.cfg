description = "Pause the game with a hotkey or with /pause. Only works as host.

Problems occur when people join a game while it's paused, so not going to get sanctioned. I'm not sure how fixable this is through a mod, and even if it is, if Fatshark even wants pause to be a thing in the game.
Not compatible with Disconnect Resilience since it uses its own pause logic.";
