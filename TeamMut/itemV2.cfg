The settings dialog shows when you open the chat.

Checkboxes are to set if a player can deal damage to an enemy category. So have a player that can only damage specials.

Stagger lowering works, but appears increasing it hits a cap, need to look into it.

Settings aren't saved when exiting the game.

Thanks to pixaal for some testing help.

MAKE SURE THE MOD LOAD ORDER IS CORRECT: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you see on the right above this mod.";
